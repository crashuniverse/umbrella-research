      <h1>Research by Umbrella Corporation</h1>
      <p>
        At Umbrella Corporation, we lead the way in cutting-edge innovation across biotechnology, genetic research, and
        advanced technological solutions. Here are five key areas where our pioneering work has redefined possibilities.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h2>1. Advanced Viral Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          Through our efforts in advanced viral therapy, we have transformed the way diseases are treated. By engineering viruses 
          to specifically target diseased cells, such as cancer cells, our approach ensures minimal damage to healthy tissues. 
          Using genetically modified oncolytic viruses, our research has demonstrated significant promise in combating tumors and 
          fostering the regeneration of healthy tissues, pushing the boundaries of what viral medicine can achieve.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>2. Genetic Augmentation</h2>
        <p>
          Our genetic augmentation projects explore the potential to enhance human capabilities at the molecular level. By targeting 
          specific genetic markers, we are developing treatments that not only address hereditary diseases but also optimize physical 
          and cognitive performance. These advancements aim to improve quality of life while unlocking human potential in ways never 
          thought possible, paving the way for a healthier and more empowered future.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>3. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</h2>
        <p>
          Integrating artificial intelligence into healthcare systems has revolutionized diagnostics and patient care. Our AI-driven 
          platforms are capable of analyzing vast datasets with precision, enabling faster diagnosis of complex medical conditions. 
          This technology not only enhances medical accuracy but also personalizes treatment plans, ensuring better outcomes for patients 
          worldwide. Umbrella Corporation is proud to be at the forefront of this life-changing innovation.
        </p>
